# C-Program-to-generate-Multiplication-tables
In this repository, I have just made a program in C. This program will ask user to enter two values.
1- First it will ask for an integer.
2- Second it will ask for the range.
Then, it will print the table of the integer that the user had entered upto the range entered by the user.
